# La Petite Sourdough - Environment Variables Template
# Copy this file to .env.local for local development

# Note: This app currently runs entirely client-side and doesn't require
# any environment variables. This file is provided as a template for future
# server-side features (e.g., analytics, API integrations).

# ============================================================================
# FUTURE USE - Not currently implemented
# ============================================================================

# Analytics (if you decide to add tracking in the future)
# NEXT_PUBLIC_GA_TRACKING_ID=
# NEXT_PUBLIC_PLAUSIBLE_DOMAIN=

# API Keys (if you add external services in the future)
# NEXT_PUBLIC_API_KEY=
# API_SECRET_KEY=

# Feature Flags (for gradual feature rollouts)
# NEXT_PUBLIC_ENABLE_ANALYTICS=false
# NEXT_PUBLIC_ENABLE_ADVANCED_FEATURES=false

# ============================================================================
# IMPORTANT SECURITY NOTES
# ============================================================================
# 
# 1. Never commit .env.local, .env.development, or .env.production to Git
# 2. Use NEXT_PUBLIC_ prefix only for client-safe values
# 3. Keep API secrets (without NEXT_PUBLIC_) on server side only
# 4. Rotate keys regularly if you add authentication
# 5. Use different values for development and production
